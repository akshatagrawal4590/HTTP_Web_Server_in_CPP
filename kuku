1) All the 51 documents in the collection may not have the date field formatted in the way that MicroStrategy can interpret.
2) There may be issue in data import, like maybe all the 51 documents are not being imported correctly.
3) The left document may have restricted access.
4) The report may be configured to remove the duplicate documents.
5) If the report requires certain fields to display data, and one document has a null or missing field, it might not show.

Next Steps
-> Double-check the query generated by MicroStrategy to ensure it matches your expectations.
-> Compare the raw query result in MongoDB for the same filter with the MicroStrategy output.
-> Investigate the missing document by identifying which one isnâ€™t appearing and analyzing its data and metadata.
